                The Buyer has the right to return the puppy for full or partial
                refund if:
                <ol>
                  <li>

                    Surgeon within a 15 working day period from the date of sale
                    and during a period not exceeding 24hrs after such
                    examination returns the Puppy to the Seller because of a
                    serious diagnosis such as blindness, deafness or a serious
                    heart murmur (other than described below in clause 4.1.1) on
                    production of a written report from the said Veterinary
                    Surgeon. The Seller will then require their own Veterinary
                    Surgeon to examine the Puppy at the Buyer’s expense. Should
                    both the Seller and Buyer’s Veterinary Surgeons concur that
                    the Puppy will not remain in Good Health through a fault of
                    the breeding or the Seller’s rearing of the Puppy until the
                    date of sale; the Buyer will then be refunded so long as no
                    damage has been caused to the Puppy physically or mentally
                    during the possession of the Puppy by Buyer.
